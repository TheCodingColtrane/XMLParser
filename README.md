# XMLParser

A lightweight XMLParser, with no dependencies and 100% vanilla JS.

The parser, has two main methods, the Parse method converts the provided XML string to a nice and easy to work with JS object.

And for those on a pinch, can make use of the ConvertJSONToXML method, whose as the name suggests converts a JSON String to XML string.

The parser is still on development, so bugs may occur.

if you ran into any bugs, contact me. Keep Coding!
